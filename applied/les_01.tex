\begin{definition}[Newton's Laws]
\newline

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Newton's first law:} \\
			If a body is at rest or moving at a constant speed in a straight line, then it will remain at rest or keep moving in a straight line at constant speed unless acted upon by a force.
	\item \textbf{Newton's second law:}\\
		The rate of change of the momentum of a body is equal to the force imposed on it
		\[
			\text{momentum } \vec{p} = m \cdot \vec{v}//	
			\frac{\mathrm{d} }{\mathrm{d} t} \vec{p} = \vec{F}
		.\]
